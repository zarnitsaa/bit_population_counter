# 
# 
# common Message # 4:
# Not enough memory was available when a memory allocation was requested.
# If this message was displayed during simulation, check for the following
# conditions to determine where a large amount of memory allocation might
# be occurring:
#   o Large signal or variable arrays in VHDL
#   o Large memories in Verilog
#   o Excessive memory use by textio
#     (readline or writeline not being called to deallocate lines)
#   o Excessive use of VHDL access types where memory is not being freed
#   o FLI or PLI code that is allocating a lot of memory
#   o Rescheduling of the same event(s) that causes event cancellation
#     without advancing time to the point of the cancelled events
# You can use the simulator command "mti_kcmd memstats" at various
# points during simulation to help determine when excessive memory
# allocation occurs.
# Things you can do that may be helpful:
#   o Use the memory locking feature on HP-UX or the memory sharing
#     feature on Solaris.
#   o Use the 64-bit version of ModelSim.
#   o Increase the size of your swap space.
#   o Add memory to your machine.
#   o In the case of event cancellation, you can use the ModelSim GUI
#     to step through your HDL code to see if the same statements are
#     being executed without time being advanced to the point where the
#     previously cancelled events would have occurred. Cancelled events
#     are not removed from the time queue until their scheduled time is
#     reached, thus the memory allocated for cancelled events is not
#     freed until that time.
# 
# 
# common Message # 5:
# This message occurs when an attempt is made to use an invalid pointer
# or a previously deallocated pointer.
# The most common cause of this problem is an incorrect use of TextIO
# objects and functions. In the following example:
#   line_out2 := line_out1;
#   writeline( output1, line_out1 );
#   writeline( output2, line_out2 );
# line_out1 and line_out2 are set to point to the same allocated memory.
# The first writeline function deallocates the memory pointed to by
# line_out1, thereby also deallocating the memory pointed to by line_out2.
# The second writeline function then fails. To write the same output to
# two files, use the following statement to copy the line:
#   line_out2 := new string'(line_out1.all);

# A conditional compilation construct was found on the same line as a

# 1800-2009 SV LRM implies in section 22.6 that the conditional
# compilation constructs operate on lines of SV code rather than
# characters immediately following the `ifdef constructs on the same
# line.
# 
# Similarly in section 22.5.1, the body of any `define shall be all arbitrary
# text until the end of the line.  This warning arises for SV code such as:
# 
#     `ifndef A `define B c `endif
# 
# According to a strict 2009 LRM interpretation the `endif should be
# considered part of the macro's text body.  That is to say that the
# `endif does not complete the `ifndef found at the start of the line.
# To avoid such amgiguity this should be coded in the following manner:
# 
#    `ifndef A

# The SystemVerilog preprocessor's line directive requires a parameter
# named level.  The value of this parameter can be 0, 1 or 2.  When this

# has just exited an include file.  A mismatch between opening and
# closing line directives triggers this error.  An example which will
# trigger this error:
# 
#    `line 66 "test.sv"    0
#    `line 3  "include.sv" 1
#    `line 67 "bogus.sv"   2
# 
# In this example, the first directive specifies that the current file
# name is "test.sv".  The second directive indicates that an include
# file has just been entered starting at line 3.  The third causes an
# error because it states that we are now exiting the include file
# named "include.sv" and will continue to read the file where we left
# off, which should be named "test.sv".
# 
# The following should read without error:
# 
#    `line 66 "test.sv"    0

# * Redhat Enterprise release v.3 update3 was the first version to have exec-shield feature.
# There are several methods available to disable this feature and to
# allow restore to work again.
# 
# To turn it off temporarily give the commands:
# 
#         sysctl -w kernel.exec-shield=0
#     or
#         echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield
# 
# Alternatively, to turn it off permanently put this in your
# /etc/sysctl.conf file:
# 
#     kernel.exec-shield=0 
# 
# (Note these require administrator or root access.)
# 
# To turn the feature off for a single invocation of vsim use the
# "setarch" program to invoke vsim, like this:
# 
#     setarch i686 vsim [options]...
# 
# * SUSE Enterprise Server 10 has a security feature related to address space randomization.
# 
# There are several methods available to disable this feature and to
# allow restore to work again.
# 
# To turn it off temporarily give the commands:
#

# SUMMARY:
# 
# While performing the negative timing constraint algorithm on each module
# that contains timing checks with delayed net arguments, a timing check
# with a negative adjusted setup or hold limit was encountered. The
# negative timing constraint algorithm attempts to find a set of delays
# for the timing check delayed net arguments such that all negative limits
# can be converted to non-negative limits with respect to the delayed
# nets. If there is no solution for a set of limits, then the algorithm
# sets one of the negative limits to zero and recalculates the delays.
# This process is repeated until a solution is found. A warning message is
# issued for each negative limit that is set to zero only when the vsim
# option +ntc_warn is used.
# 
# DETAILS WITH EXAMPLES:
# 
# For Verilog models with negative timing checks to function correctly
# some module inputs must be delayed before they are used in the
# functional evaluation. These models must have delayed versions of their
# inputs in their $setuphold and $recrem timing constraints that are used
# in their functional evaluation. The timing checks are performed on the
# inputs while the model's functional evaluation uses the delayed version
# of the inputs.
# 
# For example, given a posedge D-flipflop module with a negative setup
# limit like:
# 
#     $setuphold(posedge CLK, D, -10, 20, notifier,,, dCLK, dD);
# 
# The delayed versions of CLK and D are dCLK and dD respectively. The
# -10 setup limit allows posedge CLK to occur 10 time units before D.
# 
#                                 0
#                                      -10       20
# D(violation)                           /////////
#                                  ___________________
# CLK              _______________|
# 
# Without delaying CLK by 11, an old value for D could be latched.
# (Note that an additional unit of delay is added to prevent race
# conditions.)
# 
# Consider the inputs:
# 
#                                         9
#                                          ________________
# D                _______________________|
# 
#                                 0
#                                  ___________________
# CLK              _______________|
# 
#                                         9
#                                          ________________
# dD               _______________________|
# 
#                                           11
#                                            _________
# dCLK             _________________________|
# 
# No timing violation is reported and the value of D high should be
# latched. For this reason the posedge CLK transition is delayed by the
# amount of the negative setup limit. The effect of this delay could also
# affect other inputs with a specified timing relationship to CLK. Vsim
# is responsible for calculating the delay between all inputs and their
# delayed versions.
# 
# If a solution cannot be determined, the smallest negative setup/recovery
# limit is zeroed and the calculation of delays is repeated. If no
# negative setup/recovery limits exist, then the smallest negative
# hold/removal limit is zeroed. This process is repeated until a delay
# solution is found.
# 
# Message 3316 indicates that a timing check in the design was zeroed
# because a delay solution was not found. Invoking vsim with the +ntc_warn
# option will identify the timing check that is being zeroed.
# 
# CAUSES OF NO SOLUTION WARNINGS:
# 
# Several conditions can occur to prevent vsim from finding a delay
# solution. A valid condition is when edge-specific input delays cause a
# large enough divergence as to overshadow setup and hold constraint values.
# 
# Consider:
# 
#   $setuphold(posedge CLK, posedge D, 40, -10, notifier,,, dCLK, dD);
#   $setuphold(posedge CLK, negedge D, 121, -110, notifier,,, dCLK, dD);
# 
#                                      40     -10
# D(posedge Viol)                      /////////
#                 120   -110
# D(negedge Viol)    /////
#                                                    ______________
# CLK ______________________________________________|
# 
# In this case the timing values are correct. A negative hold indicates
# that the data path contains a delay larger than the clock path to
# register element. The falling data path contains a delay much larger
# than the rising data path delay. Because input delays are not
# level sensitive, no solution is possible for this situation.
# 
# Cadence implemented a workaround for this problem which vsim started
# supporting in version 5.5d. The vsim options -extend_tcheck_data_limit
# and -extend_tcheck_ref_limit perform this function. These options affect
# only limits of related timing checks (opposing edge triggers on reference
# or data signals) to extend them so that their violation regions overlap.
# Extending a violation region increases the pessimism in the simulation.
# 
# The ref limit for a $setuphold is the setup limit, while the data
# limit is the hold limit. The arguments to the -extend_tcheck_data_limit
# and the -extend_tcheck_ref_limit options are specified as percentages of
# the violation region to be extended.
# 
# For the above example, -extend_tcheck_ref_limit 100 will attempt to
# extend the:
# 
#                                      40     -10
# D(posedge Viol)                      /////////
# 
# to:
# 
#                             90              -10
# D(posedge Viol)             //////////////////
# 
# so an -extend_tcheck_ref_limit 1000 will converge and provide limits of:
# 
#                        110                   -10
# D(posedge Viol)        ///////////////////////
#                 120   -110
# D(negedge Viol)    /////
# 
# Note that the violation region is extended only enough to converge.
# With this violation region, dD can have a delay of 110, which satisfies
# both timing checks.
# 
# Often no timing solution is found because a timing check constraint is
# not being annotated correctly, causing a default value that is incompatible
# with the loaded delays in the rest of the design to be used in the model.
# 
# 
# For example, consider a model where the default timing values are 1 and
# for some reason the $recrem is not annotated from the SDF file so the
# default timing values are used. The timing would be the following:
# 
#   $setuphold(posedge CLK, D, -10, 20, notifier,,, dCLK, dD);
#   $setuphold(negedge PRESET, D, -25, 30, notifier,,, dPRESET, dD);
#   $recrem(posedge CLK, negedge PRESET, 1, 1, notifier,,, dCLK, dPRESET);
# 
# To satisfy the negative setups, delays of 11 for dCLK and 26 for dPRESET
# are calculated.

# In an attempt to solve this, dD is delayed by 9 (so the delays for dCLK
# and dPreset could be made 29 and 30 respectively.

#                                          -19   29

# Grepping for the demangled demangled symbol name would help locate the erroneous code.
# In some cases however, c++filt won't be able to demangle the name properly. For example,
# when the virtual table of a class is not correct, a symbol is undefined. The symbol might
# be something like "_ZTV4proc". This symbol is for the virtual table of the class proc.
# In most cases the class name is embedded in the symbol. A virtual table of a class might

# is being linked in from the ModelSim libraries. In this scenario, nm can be used to determine
# the object file or library that contains reference to the particular symbol

# Limited class logging and viewing has been added to this release as a
# beta feature. Many class types can now be logged into the vsim.wlf file
# for post-simulation viewing using the "vsim -view vsim.wlf" command.
# Viewing of class variables in the wave window during simulation is not
# yet supported and may lead to problems if they are added to the wave
# window during simulation.
# Class variables will not be logged as part of a wildcard log command
# (i.e. "add log *" will not cause class variables to be logged).  So
# existing scripts will not be affected.  To log class variables, you must
# log them specifically by name:
#   class myClass;
#     ...
#   endclass
#   myclass myClassVariable = new;
# 
#   VSIM> add log *                 #Will not log class variables
#   VSIM> add log myClassVariable
# 
# In addition, you can also log all class objects of a particular class type
# using the "add log -class" command with the name of the class.  For example,
#   add log -class myClass
# This will log all objects of the type myClass or any derived classes of
# myClass that come into existence following the add log command.
# When viewing class variable waveforms post-simulation using
# "vsim -view vsim.wlf" you will notice class variable values in the wave
# window having values such as "@1", "@2", etc.  These are ModelSim's
# representation of the object handles that the class variable contains.  So
# at time 100, myClassVariable might contain "@1" while at time 200 it will
# change to "@2".   These object handles can themselves be waved using
# "add wave @1" and examined using the examine command "examine @2".

# Multiply-defined symbols colliding in different object files are causing linker errors. There are

# o If you are not using include guards in your header files, add them and re-compile.
#   (Include guards are the #ifndef <filename>_H / #define <filename>_H /
#   #endif used in the SystemC header files). 
# 
# o If you have an out-of-line function defined in a .h file, you can either move
#   the function to a .cpp file, or you can convert the function to be inline. Add the
#   inline keyword in front of the function definition to give it 'internal
#   linkage'. This makes the function 'internal' to the .o file, and the
#   function's symbols will never collide with a symbol in another .o file.
# 
# o Sometimes compilers don't honor the inline keyword.  If that is the case,
#   you may be able to use compiler switches to perform more aggressive
#   inlining. Please check the compiler documentation for more details.
# 
# o One might compile a file in a library and then remove some functionality from this file
#   to another file and recompile only the new file. Since the original file is not recompiled, the
#   same symbols will exist in both the original and the new object files causing symbol collisions.
#   Use vdel to delete the contents of the library and recompile the full design.

# ucdb Message # 6846:
# Because a test-associated merge does not perfectly preserve information, it can
# be misleading in some circumstances. These circumstances are detected during
# the merge. Features will warn when they rely on a test-associated merge file
# which has any of these suspect cases:
#   1. The at_least value is > 1 for covergroup bins or cover directives.
#      This occurs when option.at_least is set > 1 in a covergroup scope, or when
#      the 'fcover configure -at_least' CLI is used to set at_least > 1 for a
#      cover directive.
#      In these cases, it would be possible for a bin to be covered after the
#      merge but in none of the inputs. In this case, test-associated analysis
#      will be correct with respect to the individual tests but incorrect
#      regarding merged coverage; ranking in particular will be inaccurate
#      because of the discrepancy in merged coverage.
#   2. Weights different in different tests.
#      In these cases, because coverage (e.g., covergroup coverage) can depend
#      on weighting, it will be impossible to recreate the original coverage of
#      some of the input files. During the merge, the maximum weight is chosen;
#      conflicting weights are not preserved.
#   3. Different sets of scopes, contexts, or objects in different files.
#      For example, all different parameterizations of a module are merged
#      together. Instances of a given covergroup type are merged together if
#      they have a common name, otherwise concatenated.  The merged result is
#      probably better for test ranking (where the union of all coverage is
#      probably desired).  But it is true that a test-associated merge cannot
#      yield an identical result for one individual test if it is unknown which
#      scopes appeared in which test; missing scopes or bins will appear to be
#      uncovered rather than known as simply missing.
# 
# Example:
# File 'a.ucdb' has testname 'a', and file 'b.ucdb' has testname 'b'.
# If a.ucdb and b.ucdb differ according to #2 or #3 above (#3 being most common)
# then it will be possible to get two different answers between these different
# methods of querying coverage for an individual test:
# *  Query relative to 'a' before the merge:
#    vsim -viewcov a.ucdb -do 'coverage analyze -summary -path /'
# *  Query relative to 'a' after the merge:
#    vcover merge c.ucdb a.ucdb b.ucdb
#    vsim -viewcov c.ucdb -do 'coverage analyze -testextract a -summary -path /'
# Note that the first is always guaranteed to work but requires keeping the
# original file.  The second is based upon the merged result only, but cannot
# work absolutely accurately in all cases.

# Retroactive recording is what makes it possible to record the start

#    * Adding attributes to transactions that have ended
#    * Adding relations to transactions that have ended
# 
# In order to minimize the chance of consuming all
# retroactive-recording resources, the design should try to perform
# such tasks in chronologically increasing order.  The key idea
# is that the offset into the past from the present, the "delay",
# should not be increasing.  That is, the design should avoid working

# This error indicates that the design is violating rules for concurrent
# transactions.  Normally, transactions may be concurrent with each other
# on a stream.  The TX engine creates sub streams (fibers) as needed to keep
# things organized.  In particular, using start or end times that are not
# the current simulation time may force the TX engine to move a transaction
# to a new or unexpected sub stream.  This is normal.
# 
# Phase transactions, those started with a reference to another transaction,
# add additional limits.  Specifically, the TX engine can't create extra 
# sub streams to resolve concurrency issues.  Therefore, the start and end
# times on phase transactions are monitored.  In particular, the start and 
# end times must be no earlier/later than the start/end of the parent 
# transaction or any of ITS ancestors.  In addition, the phase transaction 
# may not overlap any of its peers (other phase transactions with the
# same parent transaction).
# 
# If this warning includes the text 'was forced to adjust', it means that the TX
# engine actually changed the start or end time to comply with the rules for
# transaction concurrency.  If the text includes the words 'suggests adjusting',
# it means the TX engine noticed a problem, but has not done anything about it.
